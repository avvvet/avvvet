### Hi there 👋 Awet here !

The product comes first , not the code ! 

You have critical project , you want to market it fast , you want to make value , I am the right person. 

I use golang or nodejs to write product (not code) 
both language are perfect , Comfortably work on both tools. 
But If you ask me which language to use for new project , after many years of using nodejs , I say go with golang !  

 😍️
- SAAS product 
- microservice architecture 
- peer to peer decentralized application

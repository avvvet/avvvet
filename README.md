### Hi there 👋 Awet here !
The product comes first , not the code ! 
You have critical project , you want to market it fast , you want to make value , I am the right person. 

I use golang or nodejs to write product (not code) 
both language are perfect , I comfortably work on both languages. 
But If you ask me which language to use for new project , after many years of using nodejs , I say go with golang !
